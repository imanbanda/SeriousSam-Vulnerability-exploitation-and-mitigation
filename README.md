# SeriousSam-Vulnerability-exploitation-and-mitigation

This assignment was given in the SNP(Systems and Network Programming) module. This is a very clearly explained document about the CVE-2021-36934 vulnerability. This document includes the introduction, vulnerability exploitation, and mitigation.

***Introduction***

- Jonas Lykkegaard discovered the CVE-2021-36934 vulnerability, also known as SeriousSAM and HiveNightmare, in July 2021. The name 'HiveNightmare' emerges from the common name for files containing registry data, 'hives.' Hives (or hive files) are a shorthand for the proprietary database files that Windows uses to store registry data in the c:\Windows\system32\config folder. Secret data such as passwords and security tokens, which regular users are not supposed to be able to access, are stored in three hive files called SAM, SECURITY, and SYSTEM.
